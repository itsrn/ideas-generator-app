# ideas-generator-app
A simple app that gives random ideas that (hopefully) do not exist yet, powered by the [thisideadoesnotexist.com](https://thisideadoesnotexist.com/).

The app was made with `expo` and `react-native`.

## ðŸ“© Installing the app
Go to the releases tab, download the `app-release.apk`, and install it on your Android phone.

## ðŸ›  Using the source
- Download the source code (through `git clone` or just download the .zip folder).
- Install (through NPM or another package manager you are using): `react-native`, `@expo-google-fonts`, `@react-native-material`, `cheerio-without-node-native`, `expo`, `react`.
- After that, you can use the Expo Go mobile app to try the app.

## ðŸ“‘ License
Although this project is not licensed (because it is powered by another site I don't own) I would be thankful if you used this code in the project and credited me.
